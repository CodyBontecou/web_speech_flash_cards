# Web Speech Flash Cards

The goal of this project is to upload [Anki decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/) to a web app that allows for speech-to-text recognition as well as text-to-speech.

Speech-to-text is being powered by Google Chrome's [SpeechRecognition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) api

Text-to-speech is being powered by Google Chrome's [SpeechSynthesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) api.
